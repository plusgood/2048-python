2048-python with AI
===========
Forked from Yangshun (thanks)!
I plan to add a simple AI to this version as an exercise for my school's CS club

Based on the popular game [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) by Gabriele Cirulli, here is a Python version that uses TKinter.

To start the game, run:
    
    $ python puzzle.py
